> Create video backgrounds from a YouTube, Vimeo or video file links.

This project started as a simple 100 liner jQuery plugin for YouTube video backgrounds. The idea behind it was to have a straightforward minimal way to add a YouTube video as a background for a div, or any other HTML element. It was intended to be used on hero and banner elements mostly. You would add a data attribute to the element, and the script would take care of the rest, no CSS required.

```html
    <div data-vbg="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEpEeyqGlxA"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        jQuery(document).ready(function() {
            jQuery('[data-vbg]').youtube_background();
        });
    </script>
```

Since it's creation it has evolved to support Vimeo and video files as well. Numerous features were added out of necessity on other projects or by community requests.

After numerous iterations and is now a fully fledged ES module that can be used with or without jQuery. It is also available as a standalone script.

[DEMO HERE ‚û°Ô∏è](http://stamat.github.io/youtube-background/)

P.S.

The future development of this project will most probably be moved to a new repo and going towards a custom element implementation (this is a maybe, I kinda like the factory class) and completely excluding jQuery. The goal will be to stay focused on the primary use case but to provide an extensive API for possible extensions.

## Features

* **No CSS required** - the script takes care of everything
* **YouTube**, **Vimeo** and **video files** support
* **jQuery** plugin and **ESM** module
* **Lazyloading** - lazyload the iframe/video
* YouTube and Vimeo **cookies** are disabled by default
* YouTube and Vimeo player API scrips are loaded only when needed

## Installation

### As a ESM module

To install the package from NPM run:
```
npm install youtube-background
```

Then import the script just like any other ESM module (if your bundler supports resolving `node_modules`, your import will look like this, otherwise you'll have to provide the full path to the script):

```
import 'youtube-background';
```

If you are using a bundler and you wish to use this script as a jQuery plugin, don't forget to import jQuery too.

### Over CDN

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/youtube-background/jquery.youtube-background.js"></script>
```
or minified:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/youtube-background/jquery.youtube-background.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

There are two ways to use this script: as a jQuery plugin or vanilla ES6 implementation via the factory class.

### ES6 Way
 **As of version 1.0.6 jQuery is no longer a dependency**, but purely optional. To initialize video backgrounds without jQuery use the global class: `new VideoBackgrounds('[data-vbg]');`.

```javascript
    import VideoBackgrounds from 'youtube-background'; // or if you are loading it from CDN as a standalone script, you can use the global variable `VideoBackgrounds`

    const videoBackground = new VideoBackgrounds('[data-vbg]');
```

`VideoBackgrounds` is a factory class - this means that it is used to create and index multiple instances of the video backgrounds depending on the link type: YouTube, Vimeo or video file. It accepts a selector as a parameter and properties that will be applied to all instances queried by the selector.

To initialize video backgrounds with jQuery

This class instance also indexes all of the individual video background instances by UID in it's property `index`, so you can access them later on if you need to.

UID is assigned to all target elements as a `data-vbg-uid` attribute when the video background is initialized. You can get the instance of the element by using a `get` function of the factory instance, which accepts the element object, where the element object must have the UID attribute.

```javascript
    // get the first element
    const firstElement = document.querySelector('[data-vbg]');

    // get the first instance instance by UID
    const firstInstance = videoBackground.get(firstElement);
```

You can programmatically control the video playing in the background regardless of the provider and access all of it's properties via the instance object.

```javascript
    // current state of the video
    console.log(firstInstance.currentState);

    // current time of the video in seconds
    console.log(firstInstance.currentTime);

    // percentage of the video that has been played
    console.log(firstInstance.percentComplete);

    // the element that the video background is attached to. `firstElement` from the above example
    console.log(firstInstance.element);

    // play the video
    firstInstance.play();

    // pause the video
    firstInstance.pause();

    // mute the video
    firstInstance.mute();

    // unmute the video
    firstInstance.unmute();

    // set the video source
    firstInstance.setSource('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEpEeyqGlxA');

    // set the video volume
    firstInstance.setVolume(0.5);

    // seek the video to a specific percentage complete
    firstInstance.seek(25);

    // seek the video to a specific time in seconds
    firstInstance.seekTo(1.25);

    // set Start At seconds
    firstInstance.setStartAt(10);

    // set End At in seconds
    firstInstance.setEndAt(20);
```

In order to destroy the video background and revert the element to it's pre-initialization state, you can use the `destroy` function of the factory instance.

```javascript
    // destroy the video background by providing the element
    videoBackground.destroy(firstElement);

    // or by providing the instance videoBackground.destroy(firstInstance);
```

If you wish to tune to the videos events, you can add listeners to the element that you've initialized the video background on. In `event.detail` you will get the instance object of the video background. Do refer to the [Events](#events) section for the list of all events.

```javascript
    firstElement.addEventListener('video-background-ready', function(event) {
        console.log('video-background-ready'); // the video instance object
        console.log(event.detail); // the video instance object
    })
```

The factory class takes a selector as a parameter. The selector can be a string, a DOM element, or a jQuery object.

Usage is pretty simple, add a data attribute **data-vbg** containing a full YouTube, Vimeo or video file link or just the YouTube or Vimeo ID.

You can trigger all elements containing the noted attribute with `$("[data-vbg]").youtube_background();`, or specify your selector, on jQuery document ready event.

### Properties

Property | Default | Accepts | Description
-------- | ------- | ------- | -----------
**play-button** | false | boolean | Adds a toggle pause button
**mute-button** | false | boolean | Adds a toggle mute button
**autoplay** | true | boolean | Autoplay loaded video
**muted** | true | boolean | Load video muted
**loop** | true | boolean | Loop loaded video
**mobile** | false | boolean | Keep the youtube embed on mobile
**fit-box** | false | boolean | Set iframe to fit the container, meaning `width: 100%; height: 100%`
**inline-styles** | true | boolean | Enable/disable inline styles from the iframe and wrapper. The default wrapper styles are: `background-size: cover;`, `background-repeat: no-repeat;` and `background-position: center;`; the default iframe styles are `top: 50%;`, `left: 50%;`, `transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);`, `position: absolute;`, and `opacity: 0;`
**load-background** | false | boolean | Fetch background from youtube or vimeo **THIS DEFAULTS TO FALSE** since v1.0.18. It is recommended that you provide and host your own background photo preferably as an image element with `srcset` and `loading="lazy"` for performance reasons. Works only with **YouTube** and **Vimeo**.
**poster** | null | string | Provide your own background
**offset** | 100 | int | showinfo:0 id deprecated since September 25, 2018. - this setting makes the video a bit larger than it's viewport to hide the info elements. This setting defaults to 100 only for **YouTube** videos.
**resolution** | 16:9 | string | declare video resolution (work in progress)
**pause** | false | boolean | Adds a toggle pause button (deprecated)
**start-at** | 0 | int | Video starts playing at desired time in seconds
**end-at** | 0 | int | Video ends playing at desired time in seconds. 0 means it will play to the end.
**always-play** | false | boolean | Video will stop playing unless always-play is set to true.
**volume** | 1 | float | From 0 to 1. 0 is muted, 1 is full volume. 0.5 is half volume. Sets initial volume. Setting volume doesn't work on mobile, so this setting won't have an effect on mobile.
**no-cookie** | true | boolean | Disable cookies. This will prevent **YouTube** and **Vimeo** from storing information and tracking you across the web. It is set to true by default.
**force-on-low-battery** | false | boolean | When mobile device is on battery saver mode, the videos will not autoplay. This setting will force autoplay on battery saver mode on user first interaction. This setting is set to false by default. Be mindful of your users and their data plans, and their battery life.
**lazyloading** | false | boolean | Lazyload the ifreame/video. This setting is set to false by default. Keep in mind that the script tracks the intersecting videos and pauses them when they are not visible for the reasons of improving the performance. Use lazyloading to minimize the data usage and improve performance even more.

            jQuery('[data-vbg]').youtube_background({
      				'play-button': true
      			});
        });
    </script>
```

### Instance Methods

* **play** - play the video
* **pause** - pause the video
* **mute** - mute the video
* **unmute** - unmute the video
* **setSource** - set the video source
* **setVolume** - set the video volume
* **seek** - seek the video to a specific percentage complete
* **seekTo** - seek the video to a specific time in seconds

### Instance variables
* **currentState** - the current state of the video. It can be: `notstarted`, `ended`, `playing`, `paused`, `buffering`.
* **currentTime** - the current time of the video in seconds
* **percentComplete** - the percentage of the video that has been played
* **element** - the element that the video background is attached to
* **playerElement** - the element of the video player, meaning either an iframe in case of YouTube and Vimeo, or a video element
* **player** - the video player object, meaning either a YouTube or Vimeo player object, or a video element in case of HTML5 video

### Events

* **video-background-ready** - when the video is ready to play, this event is triggered. HTML5 videos are ready to play immediately.
* **video-background-time-update** - whenever the time of the video changes while video is playing, this event is triggered. The current time is available from the instance variable `event.detail.currentTime`. On Vimeo and YouTube this event is fired in 250ms intervals.
* **video-background-state-change** - video changes state. The state is available from the instance variable `event.detail.currentState`. It can be: `notstarted`, `ended`, `playing`, `paused`, `buffering`.
* **video-background-play** - video starts playing
* **video-background-pause** - video is paused
* **video-background-ended** - video ended event. Keep in mind that if loop is set to true the video will start playing from the start after this event.
* **video-background-mute** - video sound is muted
* **video-background-unmute** - video sound is unmuted
* **video-background-volume-change** - video volume is changed. The volume is available from the instance variable `event.detail.volume`.
* **video-background-resize** - when the video background is resized, this event is fired.
* **video-background-destroyed** - when the video background is destroyed using the `destroy` function of the instance and reverted to pre-initialization state, this event is fired.

Events bubble. If you go vanilla, you can get the video object via `event.detail`.

You can add listeners to the events onto the element that you've initialized the video background. If the ID of that element is `#video-background`, you can add listeners like this:

```javascript
document.querySelector('#video-background').addEventListener('video-background-ready', function(event) {
    console.log('video-background-ready'); // the video instance object
    console.log(event.detail); // the video instance object
});
```

or with jQuery:

```javascript
jQuery('#video-background').on('video-background-ready', function(event) {
    console.log('video-background-ready'); // the video instance object
    console.log(event.originalEvent.detail); // the video instance object
});
```

## Development

Development setup uses **POOPS bundler** to bundle ES modules into IIFE `jquery.youtube-background.js` and  `jquery.youtube-background.min.js`

[POOPS](https://github.com/stamat/poops) is a simple bundler + static site builder that I've created, do give it a try and let me know what you think. It's still in early development, but it's already quite useful.

To install the required package for running **POOPS**, run:

```
npm install
```

To run the server on `http://localhost:4040`, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Code will automatically be packaged into IIFE while you develop, and the page will automatically reload on changes.

To just build the code, without running the local server, run:

```
npm run build
```

THE END.
